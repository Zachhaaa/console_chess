# console_chess
My console chess game that I am currently working on. Everything is viewed and controlled within a console window. This is not a finished project.

To compile this project and try it out for yourself make sure you have the GNU gcc compiler installed.

There are few ways to compile it, but I use msys2: https://www.msys2.org/

go to the command prompt and navigate to the folder where the downloaded repository is located using the cd command.

type "make" to compile, and type "make run" to run. 

Lacking Features:

  -Castling
  -Automatic Checkmate check(player must resign)
  -stalemates not supported
  -En passant
